-- | The mutable version of an immutable data type.
-- This is equivalent to the "PrimRef" type, which generalizes "STRef" and "IORef".
--
-- Unlike "PrimRef", "Mutable" is implemented using a data family.
-- This means that data types can provide more efficient implementations.
-- The canonical example is "Vector".
-- Vectors in standard Haskell use a different interface than the standard "PrimRef".
-- This requires the programmer learn multiple interfaces, and prevents the programmer from reusing code.
-- Very un-Haskelly.
-- This implementation of mutability gives a consistent interface for all data types.

-- We use OverlappingInstances to allow some instances to provide more efficient implementations.

-- It's disappointing that we still require this class, the "Primitive" class, and the "Storable" class.
