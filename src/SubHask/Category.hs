-- | SubHask supports two ways to encode categories in Haskell.
--
-- **Method 1**
--
-- Create a data type of kind @k -> k -> *@,
-- and define an instance of the "Category" class.
-- Because our version of "Category" uses the ConstraintKinds extension,
-- we can encode many more categories than the standard "Data.Category" class.
--
-- There are many subclasses of "Category" for categories with extra features.
-- Most of this module is spent defining these categories
-- and instantiating appropriate instances for "Hask".
--
-- Unfortunately, many of the terms used in category theory are non-standard.
-- In this module, we try to follow the names used out in John Baez and Mike Stay's
-- <http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf Rosetta Stone paper>.
-- This is a fairly accessible introduction to category theory for Haskeller's ready
-- to move beyond \"monads are monoids in the category of endofunctors.\"
--
-- FIXME:
-- Writing laws for any classes in this file requires at least the "Eq" class from "SubHask.Algebra".
-- Hence, the laws are not explicitly stated anywhere.
--
--
-- **Method 2**
--
-- For any subcategory of "Hask", we can define a type "ProofOf subcat".
-- Then any function of type @ProofOf subcat a -> ProofOf subcat b@ is an arrow within @subcat@.
-- This is essentially a generalization of automatic differentiation to any category.
--
-- TODO:
-- This needs a much better explanation and examples.
--
-- **Comparison**
-- Method 1 is the primary way to represent a category.
-- It's main advantage is that we have complete control over the representation in memory.
-- With method 2, everything must be wrapped within function calls.
-- Besides this layer of indirection, we also increase the chance for accidental space leaks.
--
-- Usually, it is easier to work with functions using method 1,
-- but it is easier to construct functions using method 2.
--
-- FIXME:
-- Currently, each category comes with its own mechanism for converting between the two representations.
-- We need something more generic.

-- | This 'Category' class modifies the one in the Haskell standard to include the 'ValidCategory' type constraint.
-- This constraint let's us make instances of arbitrary subcategories of Hask.
--
-- Subcategories are defined using the subtyping mechanism "(<:)".
-- Intuitively, arrows and objects in a subcategory satisfy additional properties that elements of the larger category do not necessarily satisfy.
-- Elements of a subcategory can always be embeded in the larger category.
-- Going in the other direction, however, requires a proof.
-- These proofs can (usually) not be verified by the type system and are therefore labeled unsafe.

-- | Technicaly, a concrete category is any category equiped with a faithful

-- all categories are concrete.   See the 'SubHask.Category.Slice.Slice'
-- category for an example.
