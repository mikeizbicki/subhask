-- | This module provides a category transformer for automatic differentiation.
--
-- There are many alternative notions of a generalized derivative.
-- Perhaps the most common is the differential Ring.
-- In Haskell, this might be defined as:
--
-- > class Field r => Differential r where
-- >    derivative :: r -> r
-- >
-- > type Diff cat = forall a b. (Category cat, Differential cat a b)
--
-- But this runs into problems with the lack of polymorphic constraints in GHC.
-- See, for example <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/2893 GHC ticket #2893>.
